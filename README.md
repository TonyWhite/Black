# Black
Hide your screen without lock the session

# What is the purpose?

I created this script for my own use.

I don't want a screensaver and I don't want to turn on power saving. So I want all computer screens to go black, without affecting background processes.

The application is closed if the escape key is pressed.

This script has a "transparent" option that allows me to see the screens. It is useful when I need to see the progress of work and if someone accidentally presses a key, nothing happens.

I am thinking of adding a dialog box to close the program with a password, but at the moment it is useless, since you can use system shortcuts to change the foreground application.

# Privacy notes

The application is in effect a script, so there is nothing hidden or hardcoded.
